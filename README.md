   <h2>About Sahaayak</h2>
   <p>Sahaayak is an online platform which is enabled with certain features and valuable propects to improvise
      the traditional as well as virtual learning mode of education. This platform performs certain tasks, Some of them are listed below:
      <ul style="font-size:15px;">
          <li>
                An Institute can setup an admin to take overall power to maintain a web system.
          </li>
          <li>
              An Instructor can register himself via admin assist and will be mailed with proper credentials once registered.
          </li>
          <li>
              Instructor can add lectures included with videos ,3D models, images or any element or resource which can be used for Rich text formatting can be used by instructor.
          </li>
          <li>
              An whole page is dedicated for creation and management of lecture by Instructor.
          </li>
          <li>
              Students can access all lectures at once, separated subject wise in order to provide convenience and decrease time wastage in finding lectures or resources sent by Instructor.
          </li>
          <li>
              An whole page is dedicated to each lecture made by instructor.
          </li>
          <li>
              3D platform integrated with every lecture to understand concepts via 3d models.
          </li>
          <li>
              Students can ask doubt in every lecture through Doubt button included in every lecture, His doubt will the mailed to faculty responsible for creating that particular lecture on which doubt raised along with that lecture.
          </li>
      </ul>

   We the team <strong>Secrecy.sh</strong> designed a web system to improvise the traditional/virtual way of learning. After encountering the current panademic scenario and analyzing reviews obtained over learning in virtual mode, We felt that virtual study is not so effective as
   when compare with ones having physical presence. We started a research on what can be the potential causes and came up with some creative solution as discussed below.<br />
  </p>
   <p>Some of the reasons and Solutions are: </p>
    <div>
    <h3>Lack of visualization</h3>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong>: In offline classrooms ,teachers try to explain complicated concepts via giving some examples or through
         drawing a portion of it <i>or</i> bringing some sort of object through which it could be better explained but in virtual mode trying
          to do this sort of things has been a havoc for them, although there are fabulous tools availaible at certain online platforms
           which helps to explain in an extraordinary manner but they are not that effective and easy to use as per student demands and 
           those from whom we tool opinion and Hence Lack of visualization came forth to be one of the cons of virtual learning.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong>: We have given a option of <strong> <i>3d Model</i></strong> ,which could be shown both in reality as well as in browser, Instructor can add it in his/her lecture and it will be available to both Instructor as well as students,which targets this problem extremely well as user can manipulate that  <strong> <i>3d Model</i></strong>  ,It could be zoomed or scaled or rotated ,It could explain concept in 3d so well that it might be even better than offline learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div> 
    <h3>Internet connectivity </h3>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Another great problem in online mode is Internet connectivity, While listening to instructor,say if any glitch occurs in connectivity from either of the sides.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> After glitch rest of the lecture becomes pretty hard to understand , Following this problem we have given option to upload lecture, So students can watch it later, Although you might say that instructor can easily share the link of google drive ,Why does he/she need this feature, Well the answer is after some time those links are pretty hard to find, In our website all lectures subject wise can be uploaded ,so user gets convenience.</p>
    </div>
    <div >
        <h3>Doubt Asking feature</h3>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong>Some students are shy to ask doubts in the running class,further some students might live in a very noisy area, due to this when they ask doubt all other students of a class gets distubred.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution</strong>We have given a doubt asking feature along with each lecture,through this when a student asks a doubt , A <strong>Mail</strong> will be sent to respected teacher.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
     <h3>Open source contribution</h3>
     <p><strong>Problem:</strong>As we encountered that finding good 3d models is quite an hectic task</p>
     <p><strong>Solution:</strong>We had enabled a open source contribution feature so that any developer/people can come to this website and donate 3d models to this webapp for eductaional use of it </p>
